# Bike_sharing_assignment
This project explores bike-sharing data to uncover insights into rental trends, seasonal effects, and demand forecasting. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build predictive models to enhance decision-making.






# The dataset contains information on bike rentals, including:

- Date and time stamps

- Weather conditions

- Seasonal variations

- Holiday and working day indicators

- User types and rental counts




# Analysis Performed

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data transformation.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, seasonal effects, and user behavior.

- Visualization: Graphs and plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

- Predictive Modeling: Regression analysis to forecast bike rentals.
